# Security Policy

Gloe aims to be a library that helps with the way the code is written, maintained, documented, and tested. While Gloe itself doesn't have direct access to the network or sensitive data, it may be utilized in applications that do. The Gloe team prioritizes security and is dedicated to ensuring a secure environment for all users.

## Versions

The latest version of Gloe is supported.

We recommend that you regularly write tests for your application and update your Gloe version frequently, ensuring that your tests pass. This will allow you to take advantage of the latest features, bug fixes, and **security updates**.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability, even if you're uncertain, please report it immediately by emailing: gloe-security@googlegroups.com. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

## Public Discussions

Please avoid discussing potential security vulnerabilities publicly. It is preferable to discuss such issues privately and work towards a solution first, to minimize any potential impact.
