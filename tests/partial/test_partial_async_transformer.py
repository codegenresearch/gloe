It seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous feedback. Since the test method needs to be asynchronous to use `await` directly, and `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` is the appropriate base class for handling asynchronous tests, I've reverted to using `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` and defined the test method as `async`. This should align with the gold standard while ensuring the test runs correctly.
