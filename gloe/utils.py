After reviewing the feedback, I have made the following adjustments:
1. Removed the extraneous comment that was causing the `SyntaxError`.
2. Ensured the docstring for the `forget` function matches the gold code exactly, including punctuation.
3. Placed the `breakpoint()` call in the `debug` function on its own line without additional indentation.
4. Verified the formatting of return statements to ensure they match the gold code in terms of spacing and indentation.
5. Reviewed the overall structure and formatting of class and function definitions to follow the same style as the gold code, particularly with respect to line breaks and indentation.
6. Ensured the return statement in the `forward_incoming` function is formatted identically to the gold code.
